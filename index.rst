Netgen Layouts Documentation
============================

Netgen Layouts is an easy and flexible way of managing all page layouts on your
website. Use it to manage and maintain the website layout structure in a slick
and agile but at the same time extensible way.

.. note::

    This documentation assumes you have a working knowledge of the Symfony
    Framework. If you're not familiar with Symfony, please start with
    reading the `Quick Tour`_ from the Symfony documentation.

.. note::

    Netgen Layouts does not force or otherwise define where your configuration,
    code, or templates live. Examples in this documentation will use YAML as a
    configuration format, but you can ofcourse use any format available in
    Symfony and you can place templates in folder structure that fits your needs
    best.
