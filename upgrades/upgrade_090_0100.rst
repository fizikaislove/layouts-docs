Upgrading from 0.9.0 to 0.10.0
==============================

Upgrade ``composer.json``
-------------------------

In your ``composer.json`` file, upgrade the version of ``netgen/block-manager``
package to ``~0.10.0`` and run the ``composer update`` command.

.. note::

    If you have Netgen Layouts installed on eZ Platform, the package name will
    be ``netgen/block-manager-ezpublish``.

.. note::

    Integrations into Netgen Admin UI and eZ Platform UI also have separate
    packages whose versions need to be bumped to ``~0.10.0``.

Add required packages
---------------------

All standard blocks and layouts provided by Netgen Layouts have been moved to a
separate bundle. To get the blocks and layouts back, you will need to add an
additional Composer package to your site's ``composer.json``, named
``netgen/block-manager-standard`` with version ``~0.10.0``.

Activate required bundles
-------------------------

Version 0.10 requires
``Netgen\Bundle\BlockManagerStandardBundle\NetgenBlockManagerStandardBundle`` to
be activated in your app kernel. Make sure this new bundle is activated
immediately after ``NetgenBlockManager`` bundle.

Database migration
------------------

Run the following command from the root of your installation to execute
migration to version 0.10 of Netgen Layouts:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ php app/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --configuration=vendor/netgen/block-manager/migrations/doctrine.yml

Upgrading Netgen Content Browser
--------------------------------

Netgen Content Browser version 0.10 was also automatically installed. Be sure to
read `its upgrade instructions </projects/cb/en/latest/upgrades/upgrade_090_0100.html>`_
too, to make sure you custom code keeps working.

Breaking changes
----------------

The following breaking changes were made in version 0.10 of Netgen Layouts.
Follow the instructions to upgrade your code to this newer version.

* ``netgen_block_manager.collection.result_loader`` Symfony service has been
  renamed to ``netgen_block_manager.collection.result_builder`` and
  corresponding interface has been renamed from
  ``Netgen\BlockManager\Collection\Result\ResultLoaderInterface`` to
  ``Netgen\BlockManager\Collection\Result\ResultBuilderInterface``.

* All standard blocks and layouts provided by Netgen Layouts have been moved
  to a separate bundle. PHP namespaces of the block handlers have not been
  modified, however, if you referenced built-in block and layout templates with
  deprecated Symfony syntax
  (e.g. ``NetgenBlockManagerBundle:block:block.html.twig``), you will need to
  rename ``NetgenBlockManagerBundle`` part of the template name to
  ``NetgenBlockManagerStandardBundle``. It is however recommended to change
  your custom code and configuration to use Twig namespaces
  (``@NetgenBlockManager/block/block.html.twig``) as per Symfony best practices.
  Using Twig namespaces also means that you do not need to worry about the fact
  that the block and templates moved to a different bundle, since the new bundle
  reuses the ``@NetgenBlockManager`` Twig namespace.
