Upgrading from 0.12.0 to 0.13.0
===============================

Add additional packages
-----------------------

.. note::

    This section is specific to Netgen Layouts Enterprise integrated into eZ Platform.

Version 0.13 of Netgen Layouts Enterprise integrated into eZ Platform requires
an additional package for proper eZ Platform support. To activate the package,
execute the following to add the package to your ``composer.json``:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ composer require netgen/layouts-enterprise-ezplatform:~0.13.0

After installing the package, activate
``Netgen\Bundle\LayoutsEnterpriseEzPlatformBundle\NetgenLayoutsEnterpriseEzPlatformBundle``
bundle in your kernel class. Make sure it is activated after all other
Netgen Layouts Enterprise bundles.

Finally, if you have the legacy ``nglayouts`` extension activated for
eZ Publish Legacy admin support, deactivate it and activate
``nglayouts_enterprise`` extension instead.

Upgrade ``composer.json``
-------------------------

In your ``composer.json`` file, upgrade the version of ``netgen/layouts-core``
package and all other related packages (like ``netgen/layouts-standard``,
``netgen/layouts-ezplatform`` and others) to ``~0.13.0`` and run the
``composer update`` command.

Database migration
------------------

Run the following command from the root of your installation to execute
migration to version 0.13 of Netgen Layouts:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --configuration=vendor/netgen/layouts-core/migrations/doctrine.yml

Upgrading Netgen Content Browser

Netgen Content Browser version 0.13 was also automatically installed. Be sure to
read `its upgrade instructions </projects/cb/en/latest/upgrades/upgrade_0120_0130.html>`_
too, to make sure you custom code keeps working.
