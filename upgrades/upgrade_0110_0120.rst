Upgrading from 0.11.0 to 0.12.0
===============================

Upgrade ``composer.json``
-------------------------

In your ``composer.json`` file, upgrade the version of ``netgen/block-manager``
package and all other related packages (like ``netgen/block-manager-standard``,
``netgen/block-manager-ezpublish`` and others) to ``~0.12.0`` and run the
``composer update`` command.

Upgrading Netgen Content Browser
--------------------------------

Netgen Content Browser version 0.12 was also automatically installed. Be sure to
read `its upgrade instructions </projects/cb/en/latest/upgrades/upgrade_0110_0120.html>`_
too, to make sure you custom code keeps working.

Breaking changes
----------------

* Minimum required version of PHP is now 7.1

* Layouts exported in Netgen Layouts 0.12 cannot be imported into
  Netgen Layouts 0.12, due to updated specification.

* ``Netgen\Bundle\CoreUIBundle\NetgenCoreUIBundle`` bundle has been removed.
  Remove it from your ``AppKernel`` class.

* First argument to ``ngbm:import`` command, import type, was removed. Now the
  first (and only) argument is the path to file to import data from.
