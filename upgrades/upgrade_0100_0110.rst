Upgrading from 0.10.0 to 0.11.0
===============================

Upgrade ``composer.json``
-------------------------

In your ``composer.json`` file, upgrade the version of ``netgen/block-manager``
package to ``~0.11.0`` and run the ``composer update`` command.

.. note::

    If you have Netgen Layouts installed on eZ Platform, the package name will
    be ``netgen/block-manager-ezpublish``.

.. note::

    Integrations into Netgen Admin UI, eZ Platform UI and eZ Platform Admin UI
    also have separate packages whose versions need to be bumped to ``~0.11.0``.

Database migration
------------------

Run the following command from the root of your installation to execute
migration to version 0.11 of Netgen Layouts:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ php app/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --configuration=vendor/netgen/block-manager/migrations/doctrine.yml

Upgrading Netgen Content Browser
--------------------------------

Netgen Content Browser version 0.11 was also automatically installed. Be sure to
read `its upgrade instructions </projects/cb/en/latest/upgrades/upgrade_0100_0110.html>`_
too, to make sure you custom code keeps working.

Breaking changes
----------------

* Layouts exported in Netgen Layouts 0.10 cannot be imported into
  Netgen Layouts 0.11, due to updated specification.
