Upgrading from 0.10.0 to 0.11.0
===============================

Upgrade ``composer.json``
-------------------------

In your ``composer.json`` file, upgrade the version of ``netgen/block-manager``
package and all other related packages (like ``netgen/block-manager-standard``,
``netgen/block-manager-ezpublish`` and others) to ``~0.11.0`` and run the
``composer update`` command.

Database migration
------------------

Run the following command from the root of your installation to execute
migration to version 0.11 of Netgen Layouts:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --configuration=vendor/netgen/block-manager/migrations/doctrine.yml

Upgrading Netgen Content Browser
--------------------------------

Netgen Content Browser version 0.11 was also automatically installed. Be sure to
read `its upgrade instructions </projects/cb/en/latest/upgrades/upgrade_0100_0110.html>`_
too, to make sure you custom code keeps working.

Breaking changes
----------------

* Layouts exported in Netgen Layouts 0.10 cannot be imported into
  Netgen Layouts 0.11, due to updated specification.

* ``Netgen\BlockManager\Parameters\ParameterInterface`` has been renamed to
  ``Netgen\BlockManager\Parameters\ParameterDefinition`` class, and the
  interface itself has been removed. This mostly has impact on
  ``Netgen\BlockManager\Parameters\ParameterTypeInterface`` and
  ``Netgen\BlockManager\Parameters\Form\MapperInterface``, which receive
  instances of renamed interfaces in their methods. Update the type hints in
  your implementations of ``ParameterTypeInterface`` and ``MapperInterface`` to
  ``ParameterDefinition $parameterDefinition`` to migrate.

* ``Netgen\BlockManager\Item\ValueUrlBuilderInterface`` interface has been
  renamed to ``Netgen\BlockManager\Item\ValueUrlGeneratorInterface`` and the
  method ``getUrl`` from the interface has been renamed to ``generate``.
  Symfony dependency injection tag for value URL generators has also been
  renamed from ``netgen_block_manager.item.value_url_builder`` to
  ``netgen_block_manager.item.value_url_generator``.

* ``ngbm_render_value_object`` Twig function has been renamed to
  ``ngbm_render_value``.
